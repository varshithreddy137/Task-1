# Task-1  (MATLAB Wing – System Coding Club)

### I recently completed the MATLAB Onramp course and learned a lot of basics that helped me solve the three given questions for this task. This was a good start, and I’m excited to keep learning more!

## Question 1
### The first question was about initializing an array with random numbers and then modifying it based on certain conditions.

### - I used array operations and loops to solve it.
### - Functions like disp helped in displaying results.

## Question 2
### The second question asked me to:
### 1. Create an array with random integers between 1 and 100.
### 2. Initialize another array to store colors.
### 3. Assign colors based on the values in the first array.
### 4. Plot the results on a graph.
### For this, I used array operations, for loops, and plotting functions to generate the required output.

## Question 3
### The third question was about plotting sine, cosine, and tangent functions using subplots.
### - I created an array using linspace from -2π to 2π with an interval of π/2.
### - Then I used subplot to design each plot separately.
### - Functions like linspace and plotting tools helped me generate clean visualizations.

## Reflection
### This task gave me hands-on practice with arrays, loops, and plotting in MATLAB. I understood how to apply the basics I learned in the Onramp course to real problems. Overall, it was a great experience, and I’m looking forward to learning more in the upcoming tasks.

### Thank you!
